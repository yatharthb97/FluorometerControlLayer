The Configuration for the operation is loaded using a `json` file in the same directory as `run.py`. Any valid `json` file (with a `.json`) extension can be used. 

***Note:***

1. The file must have `"config"` in its name. In case of multiple files containing the keyword `"config"`, the file is selected in alphabetical order.
2. Missing fields are automatically added.
3. When no configuration file is found, the system generates one with the name: `autogenerated_config.json`.
